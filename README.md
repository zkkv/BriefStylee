# BriefStylee

## Description
A simple Java methods complexity evaluator and style checker.

## How to Build
1. Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the root folder.
2. Open the terminal.
3. Run one of the following.
- Mac/Linux:
```
./gradlew build
```
- Windows:
```
gradlew build
```
Alternatively, use an IDE in which you can execute Gradle `build` configuration.

## How to Run
Similarly to `build`, execute `run`. The `run` configuration will execute with a command line argument passed to the `main` method. That argument is the path to the file under the review. By default, it's a file `src/main/resources/Sample.java` but you can change it to anything else. You can also execute `test` to see all unit tests passing.
